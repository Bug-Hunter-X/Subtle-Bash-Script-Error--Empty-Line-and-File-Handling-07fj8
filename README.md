# Bash Script Bug: Empty Line and File Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a bash script related to how it handles empty lines within a file, along with edge cases such as an empty input file. The script intends to process each line of a file, but it has a flaw in its logic which leads to incorrect output or unexpected behavior under certain conditions.

## Bug Description
The script's main issue is in its handling of empty lines and an empty file. While it attempts to skip empty lines, there is a flaw in how it manages cases where the file may entirely be empty.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a file named `my_data.txt` (or change the script to a different file).
3. Add some content to the file, including at least one empty line.
4. Run the script `bug.sh`.
5. Observe the output.  You may notice unexpected behavior when the file is empty or contains multiple consecutive empty lines.

## Solution
The solution provided in `bugSolution.sh` addresses these issues by employing more robust checks to reliably identify empty lines and handle empty input files gracefully. 

## Additional Notes
This example highlights the importance of thorough testing, paying attention to edge cases and the nuances of shell scripting, especially when handling file input.
